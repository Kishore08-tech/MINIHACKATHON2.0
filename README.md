## Electric Vehicle(EV) Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging Python's Pandas library and Power BI for data cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and visualization of Electric Vehicle (EV) datasets. The goal was to explore, process, extract actionable insights, and present the results effectively.

## Datasets Used
1. **EV Maker by Place**:
   - Details about EV makers categorized by state and place.
2. **OperationalPC**:
   - Contains information about the number of operational charging stations across various states.
3. **Vehicle Class**:
   - Data about total registrations for different vehicle classes.
4. **ev_cat_01_24**:
   - Includes EV production numbers over a span of years.
5. **EV Sales by Makers and Category**:
   - Sales data for EVs categorized by makers and years.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Programming language used.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis.
- **Google Colab**: Environment for executing Python code.
- **Power BI**: For creating advanced and interactive visualizations.

## Key Features and Steps

### Data Cleaning
1. Checked for duplicate entries across datasets and removed them where necessary.
2. Identified and addressed null values in the data.
3. Ensured consistent formatting for columns like dates and numeric values.

### Analysis Performed
1. **EV Maker by Place**:
   - Counted the number of EV makers in each state and place.
2. **EV Sales by Makers**:
   - Calculated total sales for each year and category.
   - Identified the top 10 EV selling companies and their market shares.
3. **EV Production Trends**:
   - Analyzed total EV production per year and calculated year-over-year percentage growth.
   - Determined the percentage contribution of each EV category to the total production.
4. **Operational Charging Stations**:
   - Calculated the total number of operational charging stations.
   - Analyzed the percentage contribution of each state to the total number of chargers.
5. **Vehicle Class Registrations**:
   - Calculated the percentage contribution of each vehicle class to the total registrations.

### Visualizations with Power BI
1. **EV Production Trends**:
   - Created line charts to visualize the total EV production over the years.
2. **EV Maker Distribution**:
   - Visualized the count of EV makers by place and state using bar charts.
3. **Sales Analysis**:
   - Illustrated the market share of top EV makers through pie charts and bar graphs.
4. **Charging Infrastructure**:
   - Represented the distribution of operational charging stations by state using column charts.
5. **Vehicle Class Contribution**:
   - Used pie charts to show the percentage contribution of each vehicle class to total registrations.

### Results
- **Top States**: States with the highest number of EV makers and charging stations.
- **Leading Companies**: Makers with the largest market shares in EV sales.
- **Production Insights**: Trends in production growth and category contributions.
- **Charging Infrastructure**: Distribution of chargers across states and their percentage contributions.
- **Vehicle Registrations**: Analysis of registration data by class.



## Future Enhancements
- Develop additional visualizations to represent complex relationships and trends.
- Use predictive modeling for EV trends analysis.
- Incorporate more interactive dashboards with Power BI.
